Sprint 4 [ UI Part 1 ]
By the end of Sprint 3, we will have our backend ready for use. In sprint 4 we will work on ui part in Angular.
First, start with creating modules and components. You can use bootstrap for css classes. You can also use third party ui libraries like Pirmeng or Angular Material. This will allow you to quickly create UI without having to spend much time on HTML, css part.
To do:
1. Create Modules and Components.
2. Create tables and forms.
3. Use bootstrap or ui libraries like Angular Material.
4. 4. Implement Routing.


Sprint 5 [ UI Part 2 ]
As our tables and forms are ready in Angular we can create services to connect our api to get data from server and display them in tables we have created.
We will create services for each module(User, Project and Controller).
These services will make http requests for CRUD Operations using HTTPClientModule and request data from server.
To do:
1. Create Services for each module.
2. Call apis using HttpClientModule.
3. Bind data from server into components
