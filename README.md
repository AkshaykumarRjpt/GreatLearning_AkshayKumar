Sprint 2 [ In Memory Db Implementation]
In Sprint 2, we will create Repository layer as per the architecture. In Repository layer, repository interfaces and implementation will be created.
DbContext will be created with InMemory database.
We also need to seed some data for each module. Seeding data means adding some default data to database which will be available while accessing the application.
To do:
1. Create Repository Interfaces and Implementaiton.
2. Create DbContext with InMemory database.
3. Seed data for user, project and tasks.
4. Call repository methods from Api layer.
